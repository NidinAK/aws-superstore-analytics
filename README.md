## 1. IAM User Setup
* Created an IAM user with admin access.
* Logged in as IAM user for all subsequent AWS operations.

## 2. S3 Bucket Creation
* Created S3 bucket: superstore-analysis-bucket
* Data organized with partitioned folers:
  * orders/
    snapshot=2017-01-01/
    snapshot=2017-01-04/

## 3. AWS Glue Catalog
* Created database: db_superstore.
* Configured Glue Crawler "orders_project"
* Ran crawler to:
  * Create Orders table.
  * Detect schema & partitions.
  * Metadata stored in Data Catalog, while actual data remains in S3.
 
## 4. Querying with Athena
* Created S3 bucket: athena_logs to store Athena query results.
* Verified queries on partitioned data from orders table.

## 5. Power BI Integration
* Installed Athena ODBC driver (SimbaAthena).
* Configured DSN with:
  * Data source, region, and S3 output location.
  * IAM credentials (Access key & Secret key).
* Connected Power BI:
  Get Data â†’ ODBC â†’ aws-odbc-driver â†’ Access Key / Secret Key

## 6. Data Analysis
#### Data Preparation
* Configured many-to-many relationship between Orders and Returns.
* Built Date table & marked as Date Table

### Measures
* Built key measures:
  * Sales (Current & Previous year)
  * Profit (Current & Previous year)
  * % Returned Orders (Current & Previous year)
  * % Change vs Previous Year for all above metrics.
* Categorized measures into a Measures table for organization.
